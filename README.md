# Carl Casbolt

Highly skilled Symfony & ElasticSearch Developer with exceptional insight and
knowledge of Symfony and ElasticSearch on physical machines and AWS Cloud
Environments. High attention to detail with all the code I write as well as a
TDD and BDD advocate as tests before code mean you can have a high confidence
your code will work when it gets out to the user. This is enhanced by my love
for CI and automated tests running before every merge is acceptable. Also a
skilled SRE with an active interest in Kubernetes and IaC, because managing 100
servers by hand was never a fun job, even at the best of times.
